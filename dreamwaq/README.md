### Start **w/** docker

> Please follow the steps below when starting via docker based on this repository.
> A driver supporting CUDA 12.1 or higher must be installed.

1. Download IsaacGym ver.4 [isaac-gym page](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym)
2. Move the downloaded `IsaacGym_Preview_4_Package.tar.gz` file to `asset/IsaacGym_Preview_4_Package.tar.gz`

   ```

### Command

#### Training

```bash
python train.py --task=[TASK_NAME] --headless
```

- `--headless`: Option to run training without opening simulator window. Add this option when running on a server without display.

#### Inferencing

```bash
python play.py --task=[TASK_NAME] --load_run=[LOAD_FOLDER] --checkpoint=[CHECKPOINT_NUMBER]
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `[LOAD_FOLDER]` | Folder name inside `legged_gym/logs/[task folder]` | `Sep04_14-24-54_waq` |
| `[task folder]` | Task-specific log folder | `rough_a1/rough_a1_waq/rough_a1_est` |
| `[CHECKPOINT_NUMBER]` | Number of **model_[NUMBER].pt** file | `250` |

**Complete command example:**
```bash
python play.py --task=a1_waq --load_run=Sep04_14-24-54_waq --checkpoint=250
```

- Inferencing code to view a single agent up close: `mini_test.py` (options same as `play.py`)
- There are adjustable options in the main loop of each inferencing script, adjust True/False as needed.

#### Cross-computer Inference

If you want to inference a **model_[NUMBER].pt** file trained on a different computer:

| Step | Computer A (Training) | Computer B (Inferencing) |
|------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | - | Create a new folder named `FOLDER_NAME` in `legged_gym/logs/[task folder]` |
| 2 | Copy **model_[NUMBER].pt** | Paste to `FOLDER_NAME` |
| 3 | - | Run `python play.py --task=[TASK_NAME] --load_run=[FOLDER_NAME] --checkpoint=[NUMBER]` |

## Result Graphs

Reward Graph for approximately 1000 iterations of training

![](./asset/two_models_rew.png)

### DreamWaQ model

- State plot of 1 robot agent after training
  - Row 1: Plot of x, y direction velocity and yaw direction command vs actual measured physical quantities from base state
  - Row 2: Plot of estimated velocity through CENet vs true velocity measured from simulator
  - Row 3: Error plot between estimated velocity and true velocity
    - Column 1: Squared error of each x, y, z direction component
    - Column 2, 3: Mean squared error of x, y directions

![](./asset/a1_waq_est_vel.png)

### Base model

- State plot of 1 robot agent after training (Unlike DreamWaQ, there is no estimated velocity, so the plotted graphs are different.)
  - Row 1: Plot of x, y direction velocity and yaw direction command vs actual measured physical quantities from base state
  - Row 2 Column 1/2: Position and velocity of 1 joint
  - Row 2 Column 3: Base z direction velocity
  - Row 3 Column 1: Contact force of 4 feet
  - Row 3 Column 2/3: Torque of 1 joint
